	 <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science used to describe how the runtime of an algorithm 
        increases with input size. An algorithm with better time complexity is generally more efficient 
        and preferred when handling large datasets.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. 
        For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with the input. 
        Understanding <b>Space Complexity</b> helps developers write memory-efficient programs.
